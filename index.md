## Our project
Our main objective is to replicate Guerrilla War (Arcade version) developed and published by SNK as a tribute to the game. This project has been done by four students from the Design and Game Development degree in TTC - UPC (Barcelona, Spain).

## About the game
Guerrilla War is a shoot'em up videogame released previously for the NES console, but this version is from the arcade one. The videogame tells us the story about the adventures of two rebel commandos (in the Japanese version, they are Che Guevara and Fidel Castro) as they attack an unknown Caribbean Island in order to free it from an unknown tyrannical dictator.

The gameplay is about eliminating lots of hordes of enemy soldiers until you reach the part of the level where a boss-fight appears. With all of this you have to traverse the level while rescuing hostages and collecting weapons from the enemy ranks and operating tanks to help you break through the obstacles.
